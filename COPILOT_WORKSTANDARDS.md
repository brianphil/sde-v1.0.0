Copilot Work Standards for Senga SDE
Mandatory Requirements for All Work

1. Mathematical Rigor
   Never implement placeholder algorithms or mock functions
   Every algorithm must have mathematical foundation with formal definitions
   All learning functions must specify update rules, convergence criteria, and bounds
   State spaces must be formally defined with clear transitions
2. Implementation Completeness
   No hardcoded decision templates masquerading as AI
   All optimization must use actual solvers, not predetermined outputs
   Learning algorithms must actually learn from data, not static rules
   Confidence calculations must be based on real prediction accuracy
3. Innovation Accountability
   Before implementing, ask: "Is this genuinely solving Senga's unique problem?"
   Reject standard logistics templates - require novel approaches for novel challenges
   Every design decision must be justified by Senga's specific operational context
   Challenge conventional approaches when they don't fit the African logistics reality
4. Technical Verification
   All code must be executable and functional, not conceptual
   Algorithms must handle edge cases and degenerate scenarios
   Performance characteristics must be measurable and bounded
   Integration points must be explicitly defined
5. Powell Framework Fidelity
   DLA must coordinate all four function classes dynamically
   Multi-scale decisions must propagate properly across time horizons
   Learning must update across VFA, CFA, PFA, and DLA simultaneously
   Uncertainty handling must be explicit, not assumed away
   Innovation Constraints for Senga Context
   What Standard SDA Tools Miss:
   1.African Infrastructure Reality: Unreliable GPS, intermittent connectivity, informal address systems
   2.Senga's Direct Delivery Model: No warehousing consolidation - pure point-to-point optimization
   3.Cultural Business Patterns: Customer availability windows, informal payment systems, relationship-based logistics
   4.Multi-destination Route Complexity in single runs
   5.Real-time Adaptation: Traffic chaos, road conditions, vehicle breakdowns requiring instant re-optimization
   Innovation Requirements:

Cultural Pattern Learning: Adapt to local business rhythms and practices
Cascade Effect Modeling: One delay ripples through entire network uniquely
Resource Constraint Optimization: Limited fleet, drivers, capital
Accountability Mechanisms
Before Starting Any Implementation:
1.Problem Definition: Explicitly state what unique Senga problem this solves
2.Innovation Justification: Why existing logistics solutions don't work here
3.Mathematical Foundation: Cite specific algorithms, not general approaches
4.Success Criteria: Measurable outcomes that prove the solution works
During Implementation:
1.Reality Check: Does this actually solve the stated problem?
2.Complexity Validation: Is this the simplest solution that actually works?
3.Integration Verification: How does this connect to other system components?
4.Failure Mode Analysis: What happens when this breaks?
Quality Gates:
No Mock Data: All algorithms must work with real operational scenarios
No Template Logic: Every decision rule must be learned, not predetermined
No Black Boxes: Every component must be explainable and debuggable
No Scope Creep: Stay focused on core sequential decision problems
Rejection Criteria
Reject any work that:
Uses standard logistics templates without Senga-specific adaptation
Implements facades of intelligence without actual learning
Ignores African operational realities
Lacks mathematical rigor or formal specification
Cannot be measured, tested, or validated
Innovation Freedom Within Constraints
Use SDA tools creatively - adapt Powell's framework to Senga's unique needs
Challenge assumptions - if traditional logistics thinking doesn't apply, discard it
Prioritize practical impact - theory must serve real operational improvements
Design for reality - solutions must work in actual African logistics environment
The goal is not to build "a logistics system" but to solve Senga's specific challenges using rigorous sequential decision analytics as the foundation for genuine innovation.
